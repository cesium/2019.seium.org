      The technology on board cars has increased exponentially in last years.
      With increasingly complex software, the challenges to ensure that all
      units leaving the production line meet their requirements. In this
      workshop we present our solutions and challenge you to develop a script
      that can control and test the features of our latest handsets. There is a
      prize for the best team!

      Dynamics: The teams will be created during the workshop, depending on the
      of the participants in the room (this is not relevant, because the goal
      is not competition).

      it is an automatic human behavior that identifies and selects
      actions that provoke better benefits for the resolution of a given
      situation.

      Games are present in our lives in an irreversible way. How is it
      that we can take advantage of this premise and use it to solve
      problems, challenges, or just improving our day to day? The various
      examples of gamification, with cases of success and failure. A practical
      vision of a Gamification Designer.
