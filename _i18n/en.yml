    about: |-
      In this workshop we'll be working out computer graphics as a tool
      to generate animated scenes focusing on 2D animation. We'll be analysing
      various concepts needed to generated fluid animations, applicable to a
      wide range of platforms and fields, like Game Development, Simulation
      System, UI/UX and virtual environments in general, and implementing
      solutions according to said standards.

      Pre-Requisites: the attendants should have a rudimentary understanding
      of computer graphics (rendering)
      as well as basic knowledge of Linear Algebra.

    about: |
      What is the power of games, what can we get out of them? We use all
      days, elements in the games without having the notion of doing it,
      it is an automatic human behavior that identifies and selects
      actions that provoke better benefits for the resolution of a given
      situation.

      Games are present in our lives in an irreversible way. How is it
      that we can take advantage of this premise and use it to solve
      problems, challenges, or just improving our day to day? The various
      examples of gamification, with cases of success and failure. A practical
      vision of a Gamification Designer.
